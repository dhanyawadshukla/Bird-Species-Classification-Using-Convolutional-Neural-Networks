Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify bird species from image data, covering 10 different species. The dataset included between 500-1200 images per species, and the task involved predicting a species label from each input image. The project focused on data preparation, model design, training, validation, and visualization of the model's feature interpretation. * Data Preparation: Performed 80-20 data splitting for training and validation, implemented data loading pipelines with PyTorch, and applied image transformations such as resizing and normalization to improve model generalizability. *Model Design: Constructed a CNN architecture comprising convolutional layers with ReLU activations and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers to output class probabilities. *Training and Optimization: Employed the Adam optimizer for efficient training, managed class imbalance using weighted penalties, and performed early stopping and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. *Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using Macro and Micro F1 scores, visualized key image regions influencing predictions through Class Activation Maps (CAM) using Grad-CAM, and generated CSV outputs with predicted labels.
